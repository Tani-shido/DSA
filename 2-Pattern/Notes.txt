Patterns:

Nested loops -> Inner/Outer
In DSA's most of the topics one thing is common in them which is loops.

Patterns nested loops and most of them are loops inner and outer loops.

To master loops we have to practice patterns.

There are 4 Points/Steps to print any pattern:

1. For the outer loop count the number of lines. (count the rows, which will determine outer loop)

2. For the inner loop, focus on columns and somehow connect them to the rows.

3. Whetever printing, print it inside the inner for loop.

4. Observe symmetry (optional).
